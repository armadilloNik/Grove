# Grove OS

### What is Grove? 
Grove is an operating system. A very simple one. The purpose of Grove is educational. Mostly for my own learning. I hope to produce something that others can learn from as well.

### What features does Grove have?
1. It boots!
2. It displays some text!
3. It displays an ASCII tree!!!

### What features will Grove provide?
1. Text output
2. Keyboard input
3. Data persistence

### What else will be provided with Grove?
1. a simple text editor
2. an interpreter of a yet to be determined programming language

### Ok so how do I build it?
run buld.sh
It makes a lot of assumptions though. So it probably won't work for you. Environment setup and build documentation are in progress.

### How did I get started with Grove?
I started with the Bare Bones tutorial at: http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones

OSDev.org is a great resource, but it leaves a lot of gaps. This is especially true if you aren't overly familiar with linux & C build environments like myself.  It is achievable without great effort, but it can be a frustrating experience at times. 

One of my personal goals with this project is to provide a better OS Development on-boarding guide - specifically for experienced developers who primarily work on the Windows platform.
